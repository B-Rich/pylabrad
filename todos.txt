        allow logs to be accessed and manipulated remotely
		configurable debug/logging verbosity levels (change on the fly)
    
    move configuration into the LabRAD registry as much as possible

SERVERS:
	GENERAL:
		emit log messages and allow setting log levels

    NODE:
		node configuration:
            move node configuration into the registry
		emit signals for servers starting, stopping, etc.

    SUPER NODE:
        ask for a server to be started
            supernode looks up the location to run the server in the registry
    
    CONTROLLER:
    	show servers that are not running on a node
        make server output visible (and clearable, etc.) in the browser
        access all node settings remotely (e.g. directories, environment variables)
        run multiple server instances on one node (set environment variables for each, etc.)
    
    CLIENT:
        asynchronous client use dynamic dispatch (tab-completion not needed)
