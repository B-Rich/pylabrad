GENERAL:
	logging:
		make self.log work in a reasonable way before servers have started serving
        allow logs to be accessed and manipulated remotely
		configurable debug/logging verbosity levels (change on the fly)

	GENERAL:
		emit log messages and allow setting log levels

    NODE:
        move node configuration into the registry

    SUPER NODE:

    	show servers that are not running on a node
        make server output visible (and clearable, etc.) in the browser
        access all node settings remotely (e.g. directories, environment variables)
        run multiple server instances on one node (set environment variables for each, etc.)
