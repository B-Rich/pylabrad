GENERAL:
	logging:
		make self.log work in a reasonable way before servers have started serving
        allow logs to be accessed and manipulated remotely
		configurable debug/logging verbosity levels (change on the fly)
    
    message handling:
    	declarative message handling for servers and clients
    	do this with decorators, similar to @setting
    
SERVERS:
	GENERAL:
		emit log messages and allow setting log levels

    SUPER NODE:
        ask for a server to be started
            supernode looks up the location to run the server in the registry
    
    CONTROLLER:
    	show servers that are not running on a node
        make server output visible (and clearable, etc.) in the browser
        access all node settings remotely (e.g. directories, environment variables)
        run multiple server instances on one node (set environment variables for each, etc.)
