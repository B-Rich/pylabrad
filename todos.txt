GENERAL:
	logging:
        allow logs to be accessed and manipulated remotely
		configurable debug/logging verbosity levels (change on the fly)
        servers have flexible self.log method and log signal
        make self.log work in a reasonable way before servers have started serving
		
    move configuration into the LabRAD registry as much as possible
        
    distribution:
        easy_install
		PyPI: python setup.py register

SERVERS:
	GENERAL:
		make sure error logs are useful and informative (ie including tracebacks)
		emit log messages and allow setting log levels
		expose manhole interface for debugging (this could be dangerous...)

    NODE:
    	make sure refresh server list works (also do remote svn update)
    	allow invoking scripts on the node (e.g. for svn update, maybe with a plugin architecture)
        report info about self:
            version number, labrad version, python version, host, etc.
        set logging levels
		node config files:
			set servers to be started on initial login
			set servers to be auto-restarted if they die
			make node configuration accessible/modifiable remotely
            allow to save configuration changes made remotely
            move node configuration into the registry (which will be internal to manager)
		server config files:
			declare dependencies to be auto-started
			(see upstart, launchd, etc.)
		emit signals for servers starting, stopping, etc.

    SUPER NODE:
        ask for a server to be started
            supernode looks up the location to run the server in the registry
            dependencies will get started automatically
            
    CONTROLLER:
    	show error messages (on startup or shutdown)
    	show servers that are not running on a node
        make server output visible (and clearable, etc.) in the browser
        access all node settings remotely (e.g. directories, environment variables)
        run multiple server instances on one node (set environment variables for each, etc.)
        
    CLIENT:
        signal listeners need to be removed if a server disconnects
        separate views of servers in different context
		caching needs to be updated if setting numbers change
        bulletproofing
            make disconnect work cleanly
        some settings invisible by default (e.g. logging stuff)?
        asynchronous client use dynamic dispatch (tab-completion not needed)
        fix remote tracebacks in synchronous client version
